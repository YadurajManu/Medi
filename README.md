## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   macOS with Xcode (latest stable version recommended)
*   CocoaPods (if not using Swift Package Manager exclusively for all dependencies)
*   A Firebase project set up.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Medi.git
    cd Medi
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   The project uses Swift Package Manager (SPM) for Firebase SDKs. Xcode should automatically resolve these.
    *   If there are other dependencies managed by CocoaPods, run:
        ```bash
        pod install
        ```
3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    *   Download your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from your Firebase project console.
    *   Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file into the `Medi/` directory (alongside `MediApp.swift`). **Important:** This file is crucial for connecting the app to your Firebase backend. It's usually included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental public exposure of your Firebase project details.
4.  **Open in Xcode:**
    *   If you used CocoaPods, open `Medi.xcworkspace`.
    *   Otherwise, open `Medi.xcodeproj`.
5.  **Build & Run:**
    *   Select your target device or simulator.
    *   Click the "Run" button (or `Cmd+R`).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Swift** : The primary programming language for iOS development.
*   **SwiftUI** 🖼️: For building a modern, declarative user interface.
*   **Firebase** 🔥:
    *   **Firebase Authentication** 🔑: For user management and security.
    *   **Firebase Firestore** 💾: As the NoSQL cloud database.
    *   **Firebase App Check** ✅: To protect backend resources.
*   **Blockchain (Conceptual)** 🔗: The system is designed with services and models that suggest a blockchain-based ledger for transparency and security (e.g., `Blockchain.swift`, `BlockchainService.swift`).
